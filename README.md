R-vmsbase
=========

vmsbase is an R suite for the analysis of your fishery data: 
the georeferenced dataset from the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS),
from the Automatic Information System (AIS) or other tracking devices,
as well as the catches or landings dataset from the Logbook or Vessel 
Register, which constitute the primary sources of information for spatially
explicit models of the fishing effort. It is conceived to solve many of the
nuisance details related to this specific kind of data, providing a 
straightforward path from data massaging and management to sophisticated 
analyses and outputs.
